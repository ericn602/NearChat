# NearChat

NearChat is a application that lets you join chat rooms within your location in a 10 miles radius.
All backend features are implemented using the Quickblox API.

For further information on the Quickblox
code samples, check out https://github.com/QuickBlox/quickblox-ios-sdk or http://quickblox.com/developers/IOS
for further documentation on the API.

As of now, the location features and core of the application are implemented. Further work on the UI is coming up.

# How to Use

To test out, open up the .xcworkspace file, and run in xCode.

To test on two iOS simulators at the same time on the same computer, run the following command in the terminal:

cd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications

open -n iOS\ Simulator.app

open -n iOS\ Simulator.app

Change Hardware/Device to a difference device on the second simulator and use the app simulataneously to chat.
